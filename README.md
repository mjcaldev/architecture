# My Architecture Library
Here you can find a compilation of the archictectures I have built using cloud services to meet various client needs. My focus is AWS, but these services have industry-wide equivalents and are relevant despite your cloud provider.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Excalidraw (for diagramming)
- AWS Architecture Icons
- Git & GitHub for version control

## ðŸ”— Connect
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or implement one of these architectures.

## Next Steps
- Provide in depth descriptions of each architecture
- Post scripts and IaC for templated implementation
